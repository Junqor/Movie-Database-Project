# Movie-Menu-Project
In this project, my task was to create a command-line interface movie menu in C++ using circular and doubly linked lists. 

**Usage:** 

Functionality includes adding, searching, and removing categories/movies. Upon launching the program, users are greeted with a set of options they can perform by inputting numbers 1-8 into the command line. Any other input will close the program. 
The database is initialized with _Action_, _Children_, and _Comedy_ categories with one movie in each. The list of options are:

1) Add a new category
2) Add a new movie to an existing category
3) Search if a category already exists
4) Search if a movie already exists
5) Get the index of a movie
6) Remove a category
7) Delete all movies before a specified date
8) Display all categories and their movies
